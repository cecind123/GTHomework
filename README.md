I used VBA scripting to format, loop through, and analyze real stock market data. Please view the "Tipton_VBAHW_Solved.vb" file to see the script written. The other .png files are screenshots of the actual .xlsx results. 

I create a script that loops through all stocks and provides the:

    -Ticker symbol
    -Yearly change (from opening price to closing price of that year)
    -Percent change(from opening price to closing price of that year)
    -Total stock volume of that stock

I use conditional formatting to display the positive vs negative changes in green or red. 

My script also returns the stock with the:

    -Greatest % Increase
    -Greatest % Decrease
    -Greatest Total Volume
    
This script runs across all worksheets to cover all years just by running it once.
